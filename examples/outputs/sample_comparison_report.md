3. **Mutual Indemnification** - More balanced than original
4. **Removal of Non-Compete** - Favorable for service provider

### ⚠️ Negotiate These Points
1. **Termination Fee** - Request reduction to 15% or cap at $10,000
2. **Payment Terms** - Consider keeping Net 30 for cash flow
3. **Contract Term** - Consider 1-year with renewal option instead of 2-year lock-in

### ❌ Push Back On
1. **Price Increase** - 30% increase is significant; negotiate to 15-20%
2. **Pre-existing IP Definition** - Require clear schedule/list

## 5. Overall Assessment

| Criteria | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Fairness | 🟢 More balanced than original |
| Risk Level | 🟡 Medium (was Low) |
| Business Impact | 🟡 Higher cost, longer commitment |
| Legal Compliance | 🟢 Significantly improved |

### Summary

Contract B represents a more mature and legally sound agreement compared to Contract A. While it introduces higher costs (30% price increase) and longer commitment (2 years vs 1 year), it also provides better protections around data privacy, intellectual property, and force majeure events. 

**Recommendation**: **Accept with modifications** to the termination fee and price increase terms.
